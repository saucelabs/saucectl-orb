  This example illustrates how to execute your tests in Docker through
  saucectl.

  CircleCI require you to provision a remote docker host in order to be able
  to execute any docker container.

Note: A Sauce Labs account is required. You must set Username and Access Key credentials either through the env variables SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY or using orb parameters in order to execute the command.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    saucectl: saucelabs/saucectl-run@1.1.0
  jobs:
    run_saucectl:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base:stable
      steps:
        - checkout
        - setup_remote_docker:
          version: 20.10.7
        - saucectl/saucectl-run
  workflows:
    test_on_docker:
      jobs:
        - run_saucectl
